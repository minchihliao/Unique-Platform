# Unique-Platform
Developed a versatile 2D game engine and accompanying platform in C++, incorporating SFML for graphics and ImGui for user interfaces. The platform currently runs a Space Shooter game, showcasing the engineâ€™s robust capabilities.

## Objective
To gain a deeper understanding of game engine construction and to advance my C++ skills, focusing on core functionalities and planning to enhance graphic rendering with OpenGL.

## The Plan

**Phase 1 - Engine and Platform Development:** Implemented foundational graphics rendering, input management, and dynamic UIs.
Created a game platform that supports game launching, progress tracking, and score management.

**Phase 2 - Ongoing:** Developing an advanced rendering system using OpenGL to improve visual performance.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2022 is recommended, Unique is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

1. Clone this respositories.
2. Execute **GenerateProject.bat** and it will generate Visual Studio project for us.
